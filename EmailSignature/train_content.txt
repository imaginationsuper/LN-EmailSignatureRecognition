Dear Mr. Ray,

I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend
the Power Systems Engineering Research Center's
upcoming Industrial Advisory Board meeting in Oak Brook.   

Our  work load does not leave us much time to get involved
with PSERC at this moment. We would very much like to stay
in touch and plan to reconsider our decision in the second half of this year.

Vince Kaminski

Mr. Kaminski,

Greetings. Bob Thomas, Shmuel Oren and I invite you to attend the Power
Systems Engineering Research Center's upcoming Industrial Advisory Board
meeting in Oak Brook, IL. It will be held on May 31 - June 1.

As you know from Lance and Alex, this is an opportunity to meet university
researchers and industrial members of PSERC. The meeting also has
presentations on PSERC activities and research projects, PSERC business
discussions, current topic discussions, and a tutorial. Our current topics
discussion will be on ISO/RTO issues, and will involve executives from
several ISOs in dialog with university researchers.

Please let me know if you have any questions. We hope to see you there so
that we can talk about any questions you might have about PSERC.

Please find attached the programs for the two back-two-back conferences on 
real options at UCLA (you may also download them from www.realoptions.org and 
www.rogroup.com ). The two conferences are separate but complementary events. 
The first conference, co-sponsored with Accenture and Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, on July 11-12, is a professional conference on Real Options Valuation 
in the Connected Economy: High Tech, Pharma, Energy, Corporate Valuation & 
Strategic/Portfolio Management. For information and online registration see 
www.rogroup.com.

The second is the 5th Annual International Conference on Real Options: Theory 
Meets Practice (the annual industry event where academics and practitioners 
get together to share the latest developments on theory and applications), 
co-organized with The Anderson School at UCLA on July 13-14. For information 
and online registration see www.realoptions.org

Between the two complementary events, we are pleased to present an extensive 
array of practitioner and cutting-edge academic presentations, sharing of 
experiences by corporate executives, and panel discussions by experts from 
leading organizations and universities. Our keynote speaker this year will be 
Eduardo S. Schwartz of UCLA. 

Interested participants must register for the conference online 
www.realoptions.org) and indicate hotel preferences by May 31 or ASAP.

We look forward to seeing you at this exciting event, and would appreciate if 
you share this with interested colleagues.

Vince,

I agree with Alex on this issue.

As an alternative for sponsorship.  The UT electrical engineering dept. is 
interested in sponsorship for research activities such as the one I just 
completed or as Martin performed when he was at UT (just thought that I would 
mention this as a possible alternative).  Would you be interested in a 
presentation or a "brown bag lunch" on this subject?

Shirley,

This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul 
Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On 
reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will 
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there 
for the Wednesday. 

I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince.  

We will show Vince's name as follows:

Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately.


We would like to go to press today.  Failing that we can go to press 
tomorrow.  We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any

appreciated.

Paul, 

My apologies for a delay in getting back to you with my bullet points. The  
beginning of the year was quite hectic. I am working from home today, trying  
to catch up. 

The program for the 2001 Conference looks great; it's likely to be the most  
interesting and best attended EPRM Conference (hopefully, some players will  
be still around).

14th February.

presentation? Below is the talk he has agreed to give (he has  also agreed to

Vince and Stinson,

Alex and I attended the International Chinese Petroleum and Petrocehmical 
Technology conference
in Houston.  We presented two talks 1) Risk management in petroleum industry 
and 2) Real option
valuation of oil field.  The section chairman said our talks were the high 
moments in the business session. 

There were several interesting talks in the business section.  I am going to 
get a copy of the presentation on
Internet opportunity in energy trading, where the author did a study about 
all energy trading sites including
EnronOnLine.  A talk from a gentleman working for Costal (used to be pal of 
Song Yip) on real 
assets management is also very informative.  A talk about using real option 
theory for IT managenet was
also interesting.

Big players, ExxonMobil, Shell, Taxco, and BP have strong presence in the 
conference.

I made a copy for you of the keynote speech by Bob Gee, the Assistant Energy 
Secretary under Clinton
Administration about the energy outlook.  

Hello friends,

Attached is the program announcement for the third edition of the Texas
Finance Festival to be held in San Antonio (once again).  You will note

registration fee if you get your registration form and check in by January
15, 2001.  However, We would really appreciate hearing from you ASAP if you

Looking forward to seeing you all again in the spring.
